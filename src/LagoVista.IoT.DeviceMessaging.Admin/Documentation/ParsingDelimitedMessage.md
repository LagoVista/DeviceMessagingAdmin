# Parsing a Delimited Messaged

If you message content is text the values can be seperated by a delimiter.  This is generally a comma but is configurable but at this only one character delimiters are supported.

### Quoted Text

Depending on how your device sends a message it may use quotes (") or ticks (') to denote strings.  If this is the case, select the quoted text option.  If you do not select this option the message does not support having embedded ticks or quotes.  If you select this option you can use traditional escaped characters such as \n \r \t, etc...
